# Project Task

As described on the initial section, this Bootcamp is intended to be an experience while building a Vue.js based Podcast Player. Let's use the concepts we recently learnt to create the basis for this app with the following tasks:

1. Create folders structure using Vue CLI including vuetify as main design system.
2. Create a folder called API and include the mock file provided that will act as your API provider.
3. Create configuration files.
4. Configure main base router.
