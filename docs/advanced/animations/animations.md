# Animations

Vue.js has built-in `<transition />` and `<transition-group />` components that provide access to CSS and JavaScript hooks.

## Transtions vs Animations

Just to clarify, Transitions and Animations differ, a `Transition` essencially works interpolating the values from a state to another.

Hence `Animations` are very different, you are able to make that multiple states happen within a declaration.

In terms of tools, both are useful, you can think of transitions as a saw and animations as a powersaw. In other words for small projects or with less complexity Transitions are the one, but if you have a large app, definitely you'd Animations.
