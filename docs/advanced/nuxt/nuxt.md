# Nuxt

Nuxt is an amazing framework based on Vue.js and Node with Server Side Rendering - SSR.
This web application development framework is extremely powerful, but even though it's powerful,
it has the same markup as Vue.js, which makes it simple and easy to work with.

Nuxt has open source in [Github](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js)and it's made for server side rendering development for Vue.js users.
